I am a postdoctoral researcher working with Dr. Christopher J. Still at Oregon State University and Dr. William J. Riley at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Prior to joining the Still Lab, I have been highly involved in the N<sub>2</sub>O Model Intercomparison Project (NMIP) and the new assessment of global N<sub>2</sub>O budget led by Dr. Hanqin Tian at Auburn University since 2015.
