I am a postdoctoral fellow at Auburn University working with Prof. Susan Pan and Prof. Hanqin Tian. My research is mainly focused on agricatural N<sub>2</sub>O and ammonia emissions, and riverine nitrogen loading using a process based model (**DLEM**). I am highly involved in N<sub>2</sub>O Model Intercomparison Project (**NMIP**) since 2015.
