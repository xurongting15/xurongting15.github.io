## Primary research interests are to understand and quantify human and natural controls over ecosystem patterns and processes by using ecosystem modeling, satellite imagery and geospatial datasets, and data-model assimilation at various spatial and temporal scales. Current research focuses on:
  * Examining the dynamics of ecosystem (natural and agricultural) functions and services in response to multiple environmental changes in climate, land use and cover patterns, agronomic practices, and atmospheric composition (CO2 and nitrogen deposition), and disturbances (e.g., drought, hurricane, fire);
  * Investigating global and regional nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling: N (or P) inputs (chemical fertilizer, livestock excreta) and losses (land-atmosphere interface: NH3, N2O, and NO emissions; land-coastal linkage: riverine N and P loadings);
  * Mapping land use and land cover change and studying its effects on water and air quality through coupling machine/deep learning techniques with remotely sensed data products and ecosystem modeling;
  * Predicting crop yield under environmental changes.
