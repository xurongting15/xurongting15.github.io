Global nitrous oxide emissions from streams and rivers: A process-based modeling study	Talk	yao_agu2018	AGU Fall Meeting 2018	2018-12-11	"Washington, DC"	https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm18/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/422095	"Nitrous dioxide (N2O) is the third important greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) and also contributes to ozone depletion in the stratosphere. Previous studies are mainly focused on N2O emissions from soils; however, emissions from riverine systems are far from uncertain due to lack of observations and modeling framework. Here, we developed a process-based riverine N2O module based on a scale adaptive river routine scheme and coupled it with the dynamic land ecosystem model (DLEM) to quantify the global riverine N2O emission and its spatiotemporal variations from 1900 to 2016. Global riverine N2O emissions are further attributed to the controlling factors of climate variability, nitrogen (N) fertilizer and manure application, carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilization, and atmospheric nitrogen deposition.. Our results suggested that riverine N2O fluxes were tripled during the past century. Developing countries, such as China and India, accounted for more than 50% of the increased riverine N2O emission since 1980s. In contrast, riverine N2O emissions in developed countries reached their upper limits during the recent twenty years. Nitrogen fertilizer use has been the primary factor responsible for the increased riverine N2O emissions, followed by N deposition, N manure, and climate change. In the contrary, CO2 fertilization has a negative impact on riverine N2O emissions."
"Global soil N2O emissions since the pre-industrial era estimated by an ensemble of Terrestrial Biosphere Models: Magnitude, attribution and uncertainty"	Talk	tian_agu2018	AGU Fall Meeting 2018	2018-12-11	"Washington, DC"	https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm18/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/422292	"Our understanding and quantification of the magnitude and spatiotemporal patterns of soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and the processes underlying them remain far from robust, limiting our ability to predict future global biogeochemical cycles and climate change. Here we assessed the effects of multiple anthropogenic and natural factors, including nitrogen fertilizer application, atmospheric nitrogen deposition, manure nitrogen application, land cover change, climate change and rising atmospheric CO2?concentration, on global soil N2O emission for the period 1861?2016 using a standard simulation protocol with seven process-based terrestrial biosphere models. Results suggest global soil N2O emissions have increased from 6.3 ? 1.1 Tg N2O-N yr-1?in the pre-industrial period (the 1860s) to 10.0 ? 2.0 Tg N2O-N yr-1?in the recent decade (2007-2016). Cropland soil emissions, in particular, increased from 0.3 Tg N2O-N yr-1?to 3.3 Tg N2O-N yr-1?over the same period, contributing 82% of the increased global soil N2O emissions. In the recent decade, N fertilizer application, N deposition, manure N application and climate change contributed 54%, 26%, 15% and 24%, respectively, to the increase in global soil N2O emissions. Regionally, China, South Asia and Southeast Asia underwent the most rapid increases in cropland N2O emissions since the 1970s. Since the 1980s, US cropland N2O emissions have been relatively flat, and EU cropland N2O emissions appear to have decreased by 14%. Soil N2O emissions from predominantly natural systems accounted for 67% of the global soil emissions in the recent decade but showed only a relatively small increase of 0.7 ? 0.5 Tg N2O-N yr-1?(11%) since the pre-industrial period. Conversely, increasing atmospheric CO2?concentration decreased soil N2O emissions by 15%, and land cover change played a minor role in global soil N2O emissions. The next steps for improving the process-based simulation of global and regional soil N2O emissions include: 1) improving the model representation and parameterizations of key biogeochemical processes responsible for N2O fluxes, including nitrification and denitrification processes, and other N-related fluxes and processes; 2) improving simulations of soil N2O response to individual and combined factors; 3) refining the quality of model input datasets, especially cropland and pasture management practices; and 4) enhancing data-model integration for improving model performance at multiple scales."
Quantifying and predicting historical and future patterns of carbon fluxes from the North American Continent to Ocean	Talk	tian_agu2017	AGU Fall Meeting 2017	2017-12-13	"New Orleans, Louisiana"	https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm17/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/268156	"Carbon export through river channels to coastal waters is a fundamental component of the global carbon cycle. Changes in the terrestrial environment, both natural (e.g., climatic change, enriched CO2 concentration, and elevated ozone concentration) and anthropogenic (e.g, deforestation, cropland expansion, and urbanization) have greatly altered carbon production, stocks, decomposition, movement and export from land to river and ocean systems. However, the magnitude and spatiotemporal patterns of lateral carbon fluxes from land to oceans and the underlying mechanisms responsible for these fluxes remain far from certain. Here we applied a process-based land model with explicit representation of carbon processes in stream and rivers (Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model: DLEM 2.0) to examine how changes in climate, land use, atmospheric CO2, and nitrogen deposition have affected the carbon fluxes from North American continent to Ocean during 1980-2015. Our simulated results indicated that terrestrial carbon export shows substantially spatial and temporal variability. Of the five sub-regions (Arctic coast, Pacific coast, Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic coast, and Great lakes), the Arctic sub-region provides the highest DOC flux, whereas the Gulf of Mexico sub-region provided the highest DIC flux. However, terrestrial carbon export to the arctic oceans showed increasing trends for both DOC and DIC, whereas DOC and DIC export to the Gulf of Mexico decreased in the recent decades. Future pattern of riverine carbon fluxes would be largely dependent on the climate change and land use scenarios."
Impacts of climate variability and change on crop yield in sub-Sahara Africa	Talk	pan_agu2017	AGU Fall Meeting 2017	2017-12-13	"New Orleans, Louisiana"	https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm17/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/266990	"Much concern has been raised about the impacts of climate change and climate extremes on Africa's food security. The impact of climate change on Africa's agriculture is likely to be severe compared to other continents due to high rain-fed agricultural dependence, and limited ability to mitigate and adapt to climate change. In recent decades, warming in Africa is more pronounced and faster than the global average and this trend is likely to continue in the future. However, quantitative assessment on impacts of climate extremes and climate change on crop yield has not been well investigated yet. By using an improved agricultural module of the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM-AG2) driven by spatially-explicit information on land use, climate and other environmental changes, we have assessed impacts of historical climate variability and future climate change on food crop yield across the sub-Sahara Africa during1980-2016 and the rest of the 21st century (2017-2099). Our simulated results indicate that African crop yield in the past three decades shows an increasing trend primarily due to cropland expansion. However, crop yield shows substantially spatial and temporal variation due to inter-annual and inter-decadal climate variability and spatial heterogeneity of environmental drivers. Droughts have largely reduced crop yield in the most vulnerable regions of Sub-Sahara Africa. Future projections with DLEM-AG2 show that food crop production in Sub-Sahara Africa would be favored with limiting end-of-century warming to below 1.50 C."
"Nitrogen delivery from the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River Basin to the Gulf of Mexico: magnitude, attribution, and uncertainty"	Talk	xu_agu2017	AGU Fall Meeting 2017	2017-12-12	"New Orleans, Louisiana"	https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm17/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/275576	"The northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM), as one of the largest hypoxic zone in the world, is near the outlet of the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River Basin (MARB) that contributed to the increased fluxes of agriculturally derived nitrogen (N) since the 1950s. This increase of N exports could be primarily attributed to anthropogenic N inputs into the MARB (e.g., N fertilizer application), climate (e.g., precipitation), and land use change. A long-term data of monthly/annual dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) exports from the MARB to the GOM had been released by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) since the 1970s. However, on one hand, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) also plays an active role in supplying N for phytoplankton and bacteria in aquatic ecosystems; on the other hand, monitoring data provided by the USGS could not attribute the contributions of various factors to this N increase in the northern GOM. Here, we used a coupled hydrological-biogeochemical model, the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model, to examine changes in DIN (ammonium and nitrate) and DON exports from the MARB to the GOM during 1901~2014. Meanwhile, we investigated how climate variability, land use change, land management, and atmospheric chemistry affected the annual and seasonal patterns of N export in the study area."
Largely Increased Nitrous Oxide Emission from Global Livestock Sector during 1860-2014: A geospatial-temporal analysis	Poster	zhang_agu2017	AGU Fall Meeting 2017	2017-12-11	"New Orleans, Louisiana"	https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm17/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/293521	"The atmospheric concentration of nitrous oxide (N2O), one of major greenhouse gases, has increased over 121% compared with the preindustrial level, and most of the increase arises from anthropogenic activities. The shift of human diet and the ever-increasing human population pose a huge pressure on the demand of growing livestock population. Of particular interest is how changes in livestock population could alter the environmental health through emissions of greenhouse gases, especially nitrous oxide. Moreover, the quantification of livestock induced nitrous oxide emission with global coverage that characterize consecutive inter-annual variations during historical period is lacking. Thus, in this study, we tried to quantify the magnitude, temporal and spatial variations of livestock-induced nitrous oxide emission during 1860-2014. We include both direct and indirect emission of nitrous oxide from managed soils. We also further analyze the relative contribution of major livestock types on nitrous oxide emission. The results indicated that there was a significant increasing trend of livestock-induced nitrous oxide during 1860-2014. Changes in nitrous oxide emission exhibited highly spatial variability and concentrated in several hotspots during the study period. Less meat consumption is not only good for human health, but also favors for environment-friendly development."
"Nitrous oxide emissions from grassland ecosystems: Magnitude, spatio-temporal pattern and attribution"	Talk	shree_agu2017	AGU Fall Meeting 2017	2017-12-10	"New Orleans, Louisiana"	https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm17/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/260471	"Manure/fertilizer nitrogen (N) application and N deposited by livestock play an important role in nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from agricultural systems, but relatively little attention has been given to understanding the response of N2O emissions to grassland management at the global scale, including those from manure. In this study, we parameterized and calibrated the global land ecosystem model (The Dynamic Land Ecosystem model; DLEM) to simulate the spatio-temporal variations in N2O emissions from both intensively managed and extensively managed grasslands during 1961-2014. In addition, we attributed total N2O emissions from grassland ecosystems to different sources including manure/ mineral fertilizer N application, manure N deposition and climate change. The DLEM simulations with multiple environmental changes and nitrogen input in the form of manure deposition and manure/fertilizer application show that N2O emissions from grassland ecosystems increased significantly from 1.79 Tg N2O-N/yr in 1961 to 2.68 Tg N2O-N/yr in 2014 (1Tg = 1012 gram) at the rate of 0.017 Tg N2O-N/yr2 (p < 0.05). Regionally, Europe contributed to 31% of the total emissions, followed by Asia (25%), Africa (23%) and North America (15%) during 1961-2014. Interestingly, DLEM simulations indicate that the contribution of developing regions (Asia and Africa) to N2O emissions has been increasing significantly largely due to an increase in manure deposition from livestock. Among various sources, manure deposition contributed to 56% of the total emissions, followed by manure application (21%) and fertilizer application (7%) during 1961-2014. Likewise, simulation results show that although managed grasslands (pasturelands) occupy 24% of the global grassland area, they contribute up to 77% of the total emissions, primarily due to high level of N inputs in the form of urine, feces and mineral N. It is likely that future increases in livestock production could stimulate N2O emissions, unless fertilizer and manure N management practices that promote nitrogen use efficiencies of grassland ecosystems are implemented."
Impacts of multiple global environmental changes on African crop yield and water use efficiency: Implications to food and water security	Talk	pan_agu2016	AGU Fall Meeting 2016	2016-12-15	"San Francisco, California"	https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm16/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/191600	"Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions in the world to climate change and climate variability. Much concern has been raised about the impacts of climate and other environmental factors on water resource and food security through the climate-water-food nexus. Understanding the responses of crop yield and water use efficiency to environmental changes is particularly important because Africa is well known for widespread poverty, slow economic growth and agricultural systems particularly sensitive to frequent and persistent droughts. However, the lack of integrated understanding has limited our ability to quantify and predict the potential of Africa's agricultural sustainability and freshwater supply, and to better manage the system for meeting an increasing food demand in a way that is socially and environmentally or ecologically sustainable. By using the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM-AG2) driven by spatially-explicit information on land use, climate and other environmental changes, we have assessed the spatial and temporal patterns of crop yield, evapotranspiration (ET) and water use efficiency across entire Africa in the past 35 years (1980-2015) and the rest of the 21st century (2016-2099). Our preliminary results indicate that African crop yield in the past three decades shows an increasing trend primarily due to cropland expansion (about 50%), elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration, and nitrogen deposition. However, crop yield shows substantially spatial and temporal variation due to inter-annual and inter-decadal climate variability and spatial heterogeneity of environmental drivers. Climate extremes especially droughts and heat wave have largely reduced crop yield in the most vulnerable regions. Our results indicate that N fertilizer could be a major driver to improve food security in Africa. Future climate warming could reduce crop yield and shift cropland distribution. Our study further suggests that improving water use efficiency through land management practices including the increased uses of fertilizers and irrigation will be the key for reducing the loss of crop yield in a warming climate and extreme weather."
Global Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Agricultural Soils: Magnitude and Uncertainties Associated with Input Data and Model Parameters	Poster	xu_agu2016	AGU Fall Meeting 2016	2016-12-12	"San Francisco, California"	https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm16/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/158483	"Human activities have caused significant perturbations of the nitrogen (N) cycle, resulting in about 21% increase of atmospheric N2O concentration since the pre-industrial era. This large increase is mainly caused by intensive agricultural activities including the application of nitrogen fertilizer and the expansion of leguminous crops. Substantial efforts have been made to quantify the global and regional N2O emission from agricultural soils in the last several decades using a wide variety of approaches, such as ground-based observation, atmospheric inversion, and process-based model. However, large uncertainties exist in those estimates as well as methods themselves. In this study, we used a coupled biogeochemical model (DLEM) to estimate magnitude, spatial, and temporal patterns of N2O emissions from global croplands in the past five decades (1961-2012). To estimate uncertainties associated with input data and model parameters, we have implemented a number of simulation experiments with DLEM, accounting for key parameter values that affect calculation of N2O fluxes (i.e., maximum nitrification and denitrification rates, N fixation rate, and the adsorption coefficient for soil ammonium and nitrate), different sets of input data including climate, land management practices (i.e., nitrogen fertilizer types, application rates and timings, with/without irrigation), N deposition, and land use and land cover change. This work provides a robust estimate of global N2O emissions from agricultural soils as well as identifies key gaps and limitations in the existing model and data that need to be investigated in the future."
Indirect Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Major Rivers in the World: Integration of a Process-based Model with Observational Data	Talk	zhang_agu2016	AGU Fall Meeting 2016	2016-12-12	"San Francisco, California"	https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm16/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/190193	"The atmospheric concentration of nitrous oxide (N2O), one of major greenhouse gases, has increased over 121% compared with the preindustrial level, and most of the increase arises from anthropogenic activities. Previous studies suggested that indirect emissions from global rivers remains a large source of uncertainty among all the N2O sources and restricted the assessment of N2O budget at both regional and global scales. Here, we have integrated a coupled biogeochemical model (DLEM) with observational data to quantify the magnitude and spatio-temporal variation of riverine N2O emission and attribute the environmental controls of indirect N2O emission from major rivers in the world. Our preliminary results indicate that the magnitude of indirect N2O emission from rivers is closely associated with the stream orders. To include N2O emissions from headwater streams is essential for reducing uncertainty in the estimation of indirect N2O emission.?By implementing a set of factorial simulations, we have further quantified the relative contributions of climate, nitrogen deposition, nitrogen fertilizer use, and manure application to riverine N2O emission. Finally, this study has identified major knowledge gaps and uncertainties associated with model structure, parameters and input data that need to be improved in future research."
Historical Pattern and Future Trajectories of Terrestrial N2O Emission driven by Multi-factor Global Changes	Talk	lu_agu2015	AGU Fall Meeting 2015	2015-12-14	"San Francisco, California"	https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm15/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/85936	"Nitrous oxide (N2O) is among the most important greenhouse gases only next to carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) due to its long life time and high radiative forcing (with a global warming potential 265 times as much as CO2 at 100-year time horizon). The Atmospheric concentration of N2O has increased by 20% since pre-industrial era, and this increase plays a significant role in shaping anthropogenic climate change. However, compared to CO2- and CH4-related research, fewer studies have been performed in assessing and predicting the spatiotemporal patterns of N2O emission from natural and agricultural soils. Here we used a coupled biogeochemical model, DLEM, to quantify the historical and future changes in global terrestrial N2O emissions resulting from natural and anthropogenic perturbations including climate variability, atmospheric CO2 concentration, nitrogen deposition, land use and land cover changes, and agricultural land management practices (i.e., synthetic nitrogen fertilizer use, manure application, and irrigation etc.) over the period 1900-2099. We focused on inter-annual variation and long-term trend of terrestrial N2O emission driven by individual and combined environmental changes during historical and future periods. The sensitivity of N2O emission to climate, atmospheric composition, and human activities has been examined at biome-, latitudinal, continental and global scales. Future projections were conducted to identify the hot spots and hot time periods of global N2O emission under two emission scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). It provides a modeling perspective for understanding human-induced N2O emission growth and developing potential management strategies to mitigate further atmospheric N2O increase and climate warming."
Estimation of Pre-industrial Nitrous Oxide Emission from the Terrestrial Biosphere	Poster	xu_agu2015	AGU Fall Meeting 2015	2015-12-14	"San Francisco, California"	https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm15/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/73384	"Nitrous oxide (N2O) is currently the third most important greenhouse gases (GHG) after methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Global N2O emission increased substantially primarily due to reactive nitrogen (N) enrichment through fossil fuel combustion, fertilizer production, and legume crop cultivation etc. In order to understand how climate system is perturbed by anthropogenic N2O emissions from the terrestrial biosphere, it is necessary to better estimate the pre-industrial N2O emissions. Previous estimations of natural N2O emissions from the terrestrial biosphere range from 3.3-9.0 Tg N2O-N yr-1. This large uncertainty in the estimation of pre-industrial N2O emissions from the terrestrial biosphere may be caused by uncertainty associated with key parameters such as maximum nitrification and denitrification rates, half-saturation coefficients of soil ammonium and nitrate, N fixation rate, and maximum N uptake rate. In addition to the large estimation range, previous studies did not provide an estimate on preindustrial N2O emissions at regional and biome levels. In this study, we applied a process-based coupled biogeochemical model to estimate the magnitude and spatial patterns of pre-industrial N2O fluxes at biome and continental scales as driven by multiple input data, including pre-industrial climate data, atmospheric CO2 concentration, N deposition, N fixation, and land cover types and distributions. Uncertainty associated with key parameters is also evaluated. Finally, we generate sector-based estimates of pre-industrial N2O emission, which provides a reference for assessing the climate forcing of anthropogenic N2O emission from the land biosphere."
The mechanisms of gas generation during coal deformation: Preliminary observations	Poster	xu_omics_2014	2nd World Congress on Petrochemistry and Chemical Engineering 2014	2014-10-27	"Las Vegas, Nevada"	https://www.omicsonline.org/proceedings/the-mechanisms-of-gas-generation-during-coal-deformation-preliminary-observations-21426.html	"Gas generation often occurs during high-temperature and high-pressure deformation experiments on coal. In this work, sub-high-temperature and sub-high-pressure deformation experiments on coal were designed to explore the mechanisms of gas generation during coal deformation. The coal samples for coal deformation experiments were anthracite coals collected from the Qudi Mine in the Southern Qinshui Basin of China. The coal samples showed obvious ductile deformation and CO was generated at a temperature of 200?C, pressure of 75 MPa and strain rate of 10 -5 s -1 . The energy required for CO generation could be calculated by quantum chemistry methods and mechanical energies during these experiments were also calculated. The calculated results suggested that mechanical energy transforms into strain energy during the deformation of coal, and strain energy can promote the deformation and breakage of the coal?s molecular units, resulting in deformation energy accumulation of dislocation and creep in the coal?s interior nucleus. Upon accumulation of strain energy, the coal?s molecular structure deforms by breaking old bonds and forming new ones, resulting in CO generation."
