Global nitrous oxide emissions from streams and rivers: A process-based modeling study	Poster	yao_agu2018	AGU Fall Meeting 2018	2018-12-10	"Washington, DC"	http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFM.B24C..04Y	"Nitrous dioxide (N2O) is the third important greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) and also contributes to ozone depletion in the stratosphere. Previous studies are mainly focused on N2O emissions from soils; however, emissions from riverine systems are far from uncertain due to lack of observations and modeling framework. Here, we developed a process-based riverine N2O module based on a scale adaptive river routine scheme and coupled it with the dynamic land ecosystem model (DLEM) to quantify the global riverine N2O emission and its spatiotemporal variations from 1900 to 2016. Global riverine N2O emissions are further attributed to the controlling factors of climate variability, nitrogen (N) fertilizer and manure application, carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilization, and atmospheric nitrogen deposition.. Our results suggested that riverine N2O fluxes were tripled during the past century. Developing countries, such as China and India, accounted for more than 50% of the increased riverine N2O emission since 1980s. In contrast, riverine N2O emissions in developed countries reached their upper limits during the recent twenty years. Nitrogen fertilizer use has been the primary factor responsible for the increased riverine N2O emissions, followed by N deposition, N manure, and climate change. In the contrary, CO2ï¿½fertilization has a negative impact on riverine N2O emissions."
Quantifying and predicting historical and future patterns of carbon fluxes from the North American Continent to Ocean	Talk	tian_agu2017	AGU Fall Meeting 2017	2017-12-10	"New Orleans, Louisiana"	http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AGUFMOS33A1442T	"Carbon export through river channels to coastal waters is a fundamental component of the global carbon cycle. Changes in the terrestrial environment, both natural (e.g., climatic change, enriched CO2 concentration, and elevated ozone concentration) and anthropogenic (e.g, deforestation, cropland expansion, and urbanization) have greatly altered carbon production, stocks, decomposition, movement and export from land to river and ocean systems. However, the magnitude and spatiotemporal patterns of lateral carbon fluxes from land to oceans and the underlying mechanisms responsible for these fluxes remain far from certain. Here we applied a process-based land model with explicit representation of carbon processes in stream and rivers (Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model: DLEM 2.0) to examine how changes in climate, land use, atmospheric CO2, and nitrogen deposition have affected the carbon fluxes from North American continent to Ocean during 1980-2015. Our simulated results indicated that terrestrial carbon export shows substantially spatial and temporal variability. Of the five sub-regions (Arctic coast, Pacific coast, Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic coast, and Great lakes), the Arctic sub-region provides the highest DOC flux, whereas the Gulf of Mexico sub-region provided the highest DIC flux. However, terrestrial carbon export to the arctic oceans showed increasing trends for both DOC and DIC, whereas DOC and DIC export to the Gulf of Mexico decreased in the recent decades. Future pattern of riverine carbon fluxes would be largely dependent on the climate change and land use scenarios."
Impacts of climate variability and change on crop yield in sub-Sahara Africa	Talk	pan_agu2017	AGU Fall Meeting 2017	2017-12-10	"New Orleans, Louisiana"	http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AGUFMGC33B1077P	"Much concern has been raised about the impacts of climate change and climate extremes on Africa's food security. The impact of climate change on Africa's agriculture is likely to be severe compared to other continents due to high rain-fed agricultural dependence, and limited ability to mitigate and adapt to climate change. In recent decades, warming in Africa is more pronounced and faster than the global average and this trend is likely to continue in the future. However, quantitative assessment on impacts of climate extremes and climate change on crop yield has not been well investigated yet. By using an improved agricultural module of the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM-AG2) driven by spatially-explicit information on land use, climate and other environmental changes, we have assessed impacts of historical climate variability and future climate change on food crop yield across the sub-Sahara Africa during1980-2016 and the rest of the 21st century (2017-2099). Our simulated results indicate that African crop yield in the past three decades shows an increasing trend primarily due to cropland expansion. However, crop yield shows substantially spatial and temporal variation due to inter-annual and inter-decadal climate variability and spatial heterogeneity of environmental drivers. Droughts have largely reduced crop yield in the most vulnerable regions of Sub-Sahara Africa. Future projections with DLEM-AG2 show that food crop production in Sub-Sahara Africa would be favored with limiting end-of-century warming to below 1.50 C."
"Nitrous oxide emissions from grassland ecosystems: Magnitude, spatio-temporal pattern and attribution"	Talk	shree_agu2017	AGU Fall Meeting 2017	2017-12-10	"New Orleans, Louisiana"	http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AGUFM.B13B1775D	"Manure/fertilizer nitrogen (N) application and N deposited by livestock play an important role in nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from agricultural systems, but relatively little attention has been given to understanding the response of N2O emissions to grassland management at the global scale, including those from manure. In this study, we parameterized and calibrated the global land ecosystem model (The Dynamic Land Ecosystem model; DLEM) to simulate the spatio-temporal variations in N2O emissions from both intensively managed and extensively managed grasslands during 1961-2014. In addition, we attributed total N2O emissions from grassland ecosystems to different sources including manure/ mineral fertilizer N application, manure N deposition and climate change. The DLEM simulations with multiple environmental changes and nitrogen input in the form of manure deposition and manure/fertilizer application show that N2O emissions from grassland ecosystems increased significantly from 1.79 Tg N2O-N/yr in 1961 to 2.68 Tg N2O-N/yr in 2014 (1Tg = 1012 gram) at the rate of 0.017 Tg N2O-N/yr2 (p < 0.05). Regionally, Europe contributed to 31% of the total emissions, followed by Asia (25%), Africa (23%) and North America (15%) during 1961-2014. Interestingly, DLEM simulations indicate that the contribution of developing regions (Asia and Africa) to N2O emissions has been increasing significantly largely due to an increase in manure deposition from livestock. Among various sources, manure deposition contributed to 56% of the total emissions, followed by manure application (21%) and fertilizer application (7%) during 1961-2014. Likewise, simulation results show that although managed grasslands (pasturelands) occupy 24% of the global grassland area, they contribute up to 77% of the total emissions, primarily due to high level of N inputs in the form of urine, feces and mineral N. It is likely that future increases in livestock production could stimulate N2O emissions, unless fertilizer and manure N management practices that promote nitrogen use efficiencies of grassland ecosystems are implemented."
Impacts of multiple global environmental changes on African crop yield and water use efficiency: Implications to food and water security	Talk	pan_agu2016	AGU Fall Meeting 2016	2016-12-10	"San Francisco, California"	http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AGUFMGC43F..05P	"Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions in the world to climate change and climate variability. Much concern has been raised about the impacts of climate and other environmental factors on water resource and food security through the climate-water-food nexus. Understanding the responses of crop yield and water use efficiency to environmental changes is particularly important because Africa is well known for widespread poverty, slow economic growth and agricultural systems particularly sensitive to frequent and persistent droughts. However, the lack of integrated understanding has limited our ability to quantify and predict the potential of Africa's agricultural sustainability and freshwater supply, and to better manage the system for meeting an increasing food demand in a way that is socially and environmentally or ecologically sustainable. By using the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM-AG2) driven by spatially-explicit information on land use, climate and other environmental changes, we have assessed the spatial and temporal patterns of crop yield, evapotranspiration (ET) and water use efficiency across entire Africa in the past 35 years (1980-2015) and the rest of the 21st century (2016-2099). Our preliminary results indicate that African crop yield in the past three decades shows an increasing trend primarily due to cropland expansion (about 50%), elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration, and nitrogen deposition. However, crop yield shows substantially spatial and temporal variation due to inter-annual and inter-decadal climate variability and spatial heterogeneity of environmental drivers. Climate extremes especially droughts and heat wave have largely reduced crop yield in the most vulnerable regions. Our results indicate that N fertilizer could be a major driver to improve food security in Africa. Future climate warming could reduce crop yield and shift cropland distribution. Our study further suggests that improving water use efficiency through land management practices including the increased uses of fertilizers and irrigation will be the key for reducing the loss of crop yield in a warming climate and extreme weather."
Global Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Agricultural Soils: Magnitude and Uncertainties Associated with Input Data and Model Parameters	Poster	xu_agu2016	AGU Fall Meeting 2016	2016-12-10	"San Francisco, California"	http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AGUFM.B11E0505X	"Human activities have caused significant perturbations of the nitrogen (N) cycle, resulting in about 21% increase of atmospheric N2O concentration since the pre-industrial era. This large increase is mainly caused by intensive agricultural activities including the application of nitrogen fertilizer and the expansion of leguminous crops. Substantial efforts have been made to quantify the global and regional N2O emission from agricultural soils in the last several decades using a wide variety of approaches, such as ground-based observation, atmospheric inversion, and process-based model. However, large uncertainties exist in those estimates as well as methods themselves. In this study, we used a coupled biogeochemical model (DLEM) to estimate magnitude, spatial, and temporal patterns of N2O emissions from global croplands in the past five decades (1961-2012). To estimate uncertainties associated with input data and model parameters, we have implemented a number of simulation experiments with DLEM, accounting for key parameter values that affect calculation of N2O fluxes (i.e., maximum nitrification and denitrification rates, N fixation rate, and the adsorption coefficient for soil ammonium and nitrate), different sets of input data including climate, land management practices (i.e., nitrogen fertilizer types, application rates and timings, with/without irrigation), N deposition, and land use and land cover change. This work provides a robust estimate of global N2O emissions from agricultural soils as well as identifies key gaps and limitations in the existing model and data that need to be investigated in the future."
Historical Pattern and Future Trajectories of Terrestrial N2O Emission driven by Multi-factor Global Changes	Talk	lu_agu2015	AGU Fall Meeting 2015	2015-12-10	"San Francisco, California"	http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AGUFM.B14A..06L	"Nitrous oxide (N2O) is among the most important greenhouse gases only next to carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) due to its long life time and high radiative forcing (with a global warming potential 265 times as much as CO2 at 100-year time horizon). The Atmospheric concentration of N2O has increased by 20% since pre-industrial era, and this increase plays a significant role in shaping anthropogenic climate change. However, compared to CO2- and CH4-related research, fewer studies have been performed in assessing and predicting the spatiotemporal patterns of N2O emission from natural and agricultural soils. Here we used a coupled biogeochemical model, DLEM, to quantify the historical and future changes in global terrestrial N2O emissions resulting from natural and anthropogenic perturbations including climate variability, atmospheric CO2 concentration, nitrogen deposition, land use and land cover changes, and agricultural land management practices (i.e., synthetic nitrogen fertilizer use, manure application, and irrigation etc.) over the period 1900-2099. We focused on inter-annual variation and long-term trend of terrestrial N2O emission driven by individual and combined environmental changes during historical and future periods. The sensitivity of N2O emission to climate, atmospheric composition, and human activities has been examined at biome-, latitudinal, continental and global scales. Future projections were conducted to identify the hot spots and hot time periods of global N2O emission under two emission scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). It provides a modeling perspective for understanding human-induced N2O emission growth and developing potential management strategies to mitigate further atmospheric N2O increase and climate warming."
Estimation of Pre-industrial Nitrous Oxide Emission from the Terrestrial Biosphere	Poster	xu_agu2015	AGU Fall Meeting 2015	2015-12-10	"San Francisco, California"	http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AGUFM.B11B0421X	"Nitrous oxide (N2O) is currently the third most important greenhouse gases (GHG) after methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Global N2O emission increased substantially primarily due to reactive nitrogen (N) enrichment through fossil fuel combustion, fertilizer production, and legume crop cultivation etc. In order to understand how climate system is perturbed by anthropogenic N2O emissions from the terrestrial biosphere, it is necessary to better estimate the pre-industrial N2O emissions. Previous estimations of natural N2O emissions from the terrestrial biosphere range from 3.3-9.0 Tg N2O-N yr-1. This large uncertainty in the estimation of pre-industrial N2O emissions from the terrestrial biosphere may be caused by uncertainty associated with key parameters such as maximum nitrification and denitrification rates, half-saturation coefficients of soil ammonium and nitrate, N fixation rate, and maximum N uptake rate. In addition to the large estimation range, previous studies did not provide an estimate on preindustrial N2O emissions at regional and biome levels. In this study, we applied a process-based coupled biogeochemical model to estimate the magnitude and spatial patterns of pre-industrial N2O fluxes at biome and continental scales as driven by multiple input data, including pre-industrial climate data, atmospheric CO2 concentration, N deposition, N fixation, and land cover types and distributions. Uncertainty associated with key parameters is also evaluated. Finally, we generate sector-based estimates of pre-industrial N2O emission, which provides a reference for assessing the climate forcing of anthropogenic N2O emission from the land biosphere."
