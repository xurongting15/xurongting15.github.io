2014-01-30	The mechanisms of gas generation during coal deformation: Preliminary observations	Fuel	Gas generation often occurs during high-temperature and high-pressure deformation experiments on coal. In this work, sub-high-temperature and sub-high-pressure deformation experiments on coal were designed to explore the mechanisms of gas generation during coal deformation. The coal samples for coal deformation experiments were anthracite coals collected from the Qudi Mine in the Southern Qinshui Basin of China. The coal samples showed obvious ductile deformation and CO was generated at a temperature of 200 °C, pressure of 75 MPa and strain rate of 10−5 s−1. The energy required for CO generation could be calculated by quantum chemistry methods and mechanical energies during these experiments were also calculated. The calculated results suggested that mechanical energy transforms into strain energy during the deformation of coal, and strain energy can promote the deformation and breakage of the coal’s molecular units, resulting in deformation energy accumulation of dislocation and creep in the coal’s interior nucleus. Upon accumulation of strain energy, the coal’s molecular structure deforms by breaking old bonds and forming new ones, resulting in CO generation.	Xu, R., Li, H., Guo, C. and Hou, Q., 2014.

2015-01-12	The effect of different deformation mechanisms on the chemical structure of anthracite coals	Science China Earth Sciences	To study the effect of different deformation mechanisms on the chemical structure of anthracite coals and further understand the correlation between changed chemical structures and coal and gas outburst, ten groups of sub-high-temperature and sub-high-pressure deformation experiments were performed. All samples maintained primary structure, which were collected from the Qudi Mine in the southern Qinshui Basin of China. The samples were analyzed by ultimate analysis, Vitrinite Reflection (VR), Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Raman spectroscopy both before and after deformation experiments for contrasting. The results showed that the VR values of all samples after experiments were significantly higher than before experiments, which suggested that the metamorphism degree of anthracite coals was increased by deformation. The results also indicated that both temperature and strain rate had significant effects on the chemical structure of anthracite coals. At a high strain rate of 4×10−5 s−1, the deformation of the samples was mainly brittle in which the mechanical energy was transformed mainly into frictional energy. In this situation, all samples developed several distinct fractured surfaces and the change of chemical structures was not obvious. On the contrary, with the decrease of the strain rates, the ductile deformation was dominated and the mechanical energy was mainly transformed into strain energy, resulting in the accumulation of deformation energy confessed by increasing quantity of dislocation and creep in the coal’s interior nucleus. The absorption in the aromatic ring groups increased; otherwise the absorption in the aliphatic structures and ether oxygen groups decreased rapidly. During these experiments, CO was collected from two experimental samples. The number of aromatic rings and the structure defects within the two generated gas samples increased and the degree of molecular structure orders decreased.

2016-01-16	Deformation Mechanisms and Macromolecular Structure Response of Anthracite under Different Stress	Energy & Fuels	It has been controversial whether tectonic stress affects the chemical structure of coals. To further understand if and how tectonic stress affects the chemical structure of coals, an investigation into the macromolecular-level deformation mechanism is quite necessary. Therefore, we performed deformation experiments on anthracite with axial load both parallel and perpendicular to the bedding plane. Macromolecular structure variations during deformation were revealed by a combination of Raman spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Results show that (1) coal deformation behaviors (brittle deformation or ductile deformation) are influenced by stress direction, in addition to the temperature and strain rate, and (2) ductile deformation is related to the growth of defects, which is more favorable under stress parallel to the bedding plane, at higher temperature and lower strain rate, while brittle deformation is presumably due to the direct bond breakage beyond the elastic limit. On the basis of the study of coal deformation mechanisms, we suggest that hydrocarbon generation under stress is possible and that it may become a supplement for the traditional hydrocarbon generation theory.

2017-07-28	Preindustrial nitrous oxide emissions from the land biosphere estimated by using a global biogeochemistry model	Climate of the Past	To accurately assess how increased global nitrous oxide (N2O) emission has affected the climate system requires a robust estimation of the preindustrial N2O emissions since only the difference between current and preindustrial emissions represents net drivers of anthropogenic climate change. However, large uncertainty exists in previous estimates of preindustrial N2O emissions from the land biosphere, while preindustrial N2O emissions on the finer scales, such as regional, biome, or sector scales, have not been well quantified yet. In this study, we applied a process-based Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM) to estimate the magnitude and spatial patterns of preindustrial N2O fluxes at the biome, continental, and global level as driven by multiple environmental factors. Uncertainties associated with key parameters were also evaluated. Our study indicates that the mean of the preindustrial N2O emission was approximately 6.20TgNyr−1, with an uncertainty range of 4.76 to 8.13TgNyr−1. The estimated N2O emission varied significantly at spatial and biome levels. South America, Africa, and Southern Asia accounted for 34.12, 23.85, and 18.93%, respectively, together contributing 76.90% of global total emission. The tropics were identified as the major source of N2O released into the atmosphere, accounting for 64.66% of the total emission. Our multi-scale estimates provide a robust reference for assessing the climate forcing of anthropogenic N2O emission from the land biosphere.

2017-12-21	Half‐Century Ammonia Emissions From Agricultural Systems in Southern Asia: Magnitude, Spatiotemporal Patterns, and Implications for Human Health	GeoHealth	Much concern has been raised about the increasing threat to air quality and human health due to ammonia (NH3) emissions from agricultural systems, which is associated with the enrichment of reactive nitrogen (N) in southern Asia (SA), home of more than 60% the world's population (i.e., the people of West, central, East, South, and Southeast Asia). Southern Asia consumed more than half of the global synthetic N fertilizer and was the dominant region for livestock waste production since 2004. Excessive N application could lead to a rapid increase of NH3 in the atmosphere, resulting in severe air and water pollution in this region. However, there is still a lack of accurate estimates of NH3 emissions from agricultural systems. In this study, we simulated the agricultural NH3 fluxes in SA by coupling the Bidirectional NH3 exchange module (Bi‐NH3) from the Community Multi‐scale Air Quality model with the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model. Our results indicated that NH3 emissions were 21.3 ± 3.9 Tg N yr−1 from SA agricultural systems with a rapidly increasing rate of ~0.3 Tg N yr−2 during 1961−2014. Among the emission sources, 10.8 Tg N yr−1 was released from synthetic N fertilizer use, and 10.4 ± 3.9 Tg N yr−1 was released from manure production in 2014. Ammonia emissions from China and India together accounted for 64% of the total amount in SA during 2000−2014. Our results imply that the increased NH3 emissions associated with high N inputs to croplands would likely be a significant threat to the environment and human health unless mitigation efforts are applied to reduce these emissions.

2018-06-27	The Global N2O Model Intercomparison Project	Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society	Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important greenhouse gas and also an ozone-depleting substance that has both natural and anthropogenic sources. Large estimation uncertainty remains on the magnitude and spatiotemporal patterns of N2O fluxes and the key drivers of N2O production in the terrestrial biosphere. Some terrestrial biosphere models have been evolved to account for nitrogen processes and to show the capability to simulate N2O emissions from land ecosystems at the global scale, but large discrepancies exist among their estimates primarily because of inconsistent input datasets, simulation protocol, and model structure and parameterization schemes. Based on the consistent model input data and simulation protocol, the global N2O Model Intercomparison Project (NMIP) was initialized with 10 state-of-the-art terrestrial biosphere models that include nitrogen (N) cycling. Specific objectives of NMIP are to 1) unravel the major N cycling processes controlling N2O fluxes in each model and identify the uncertainty sources from model structure, input data, and parameters; 2) quantify the magnitude and spatial and temporal patterns of global and regional N2O fluxes from the preindustrial period (1860) to present and attribute the relative contributions of multiple environmental factors to N2O dynamics; and 3) provide a benchmarking estimate of N2O fluxes through synthesizing the multimodel simulation results and existing estimates from ground-based observations, inventories, and statistical and empirical extrapolations. This study provides detailed descriptions for the NMIP protocol, input data, model structure, and key parameters, along with preliminary simulation results. The global and regional N2O estimation derived from the NMIP is a key component of the global N2O budget synthesis activity jointly led by the Global Carbon Project and the International Nitrogen Initiative.

2018-10-25	Global ammonia emissions from synthetic nitrogen fertilizer applications in agricultural systems: Empirical and process‐based estimates and uncertainty	Global Change Biology	Excessive ammonia (NH3) emitted from nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications in global croplands plays an important role in atmospheric aerosol production, resulting in visibility reduction and regional haze. However, large uncertainty exists in the estimates of NH3 emissions from global and regional croplands, which utilize different data and methods. In this study, we have coupled a process‐based Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM) with the bidirectional NH3 exchange module in the Community Multiscale Air‐Quality (CMAQ) model (DLEM‐Bi‐NH3) to quantify NH3 emissions at the global and regional scale, and crop‐specific NH3 emissions globally at a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° during 1961–2010. Results indicate that global NH3 emissions from N fertilizer use have increased from 1.9 ± 0.03 to 16.7 ± 0.5 Tg N/year between 1961 and 2010. The annual increase of NH3 emissions shows large spatial variations across the global land surface. Southern Asia, including China and India, has accounted for more than 50% of total global NH3 emissions since the 1980s, followed by North America and Europe. Rice cultivation has been the largest contributor to total global NH3 emissions since the 1990s, followed by corn and wheat. In addition, results show that empirical methods without considering environmental factors (constant emission factor in the IPCC Tier 1 guideline) could underestimate NH3 emissions in context of climate change, with the highest difference (i.e., 6.9 Tg N/year) occurring in 2010. This study provides a robust estimate on global and regional NH3 emissions over the past 50 years, which offers a reference for assessing air quality consequences of future nitrogen enrichment as well as nitrogen use efficiency improvement.

2019-02-01	Increased nitrogen enrichment and shifted patterns in the world's grassland: 1860–2016	Earth System Science Data	Production and application to soils of manure excreta from livestock farming significantly perturb the global nutrient balance and result in significant greenhouse gas emissions that warm the earth's climate. Despite much attention paid to synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizer and manure N applications to croplands, spatially explicit, continuous time-series datasets of manure and fertilizer N inputs on pastures and rangelands are lacking. We developed three global gridded datasets at a resolution of 0.5∘ × 0.5∘ for the period 1860–2016 (i.e., annual manure N deposition (by grazing animals) rate, synthetic N fertilizer and N manure application rates), by combining annual and 5 arcmin spatial data on pastures and rangelands with country-level statistics on livestock manure, mineral and chemical fertilizers, and land use information for cropland and permanent meadows and pastures. Based on the new data products, we estimated that total N inputs, the sum of manure N deposition, manure N application and fertilizer N application to pastures and rangelands, increased globally from 15 to 101 Tg N yr−1 during 1860–2016. In particular during the period 2000–2016, livestock manure N deposition accounted for 83 % of the total N inputs, whereas manure and fertilizer N application accounted 9 % and 8 %, respectively. At the regional scale, hotspots of manure N deposition remained largely similar during the period 1860–2016 (i.e., southern Asia, Africa and South America); however, hotspots of manure and fertilizer N application shifted from Europe to southern Asia in the early 21st century. The new three global datasets contribute to the filling of the previous data gaps of global and regional N inputs in pastures and rangelands, improving the abilities of ecosystem and earth system models to investigate the global impacts of N enrichment due to agriculture, in terms of associated greenhouse gas emissions and environmental sustainability issues.

2018-11-10	Global soil nitrous oxide emissions since the preindustrial era estimated by an ensemble of terrestrial biosphere models: Magnitude, attribution, and uncertainty	Global Change Biology 	Our understanding and quantification of global soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and the underlying processes remain largely uncertain. Here, we assessed the effects of multiple anthropogenic and natural factors, including nitrogen fertilizer (N) application, atmospheric N deposition, manure N application, land cover change, climate change, and rising atmospheric CO2 concentration, on global soil N2O emissions for the period 1861–2016 using a standard simulation protocol with seven process‐based terrestrial biosphere models. Results suggest global soil N2O emissions have increased from 6.3 ± 1.1 Tg N2O‐N/year in the preindustrial period (the 1860s) to 10.0 ± 2.0 Tg N2O‐N/year in the recent decade (2007–2016). Cropland soil emissions increased from 0.3 Tg N2O‐N/year to 3.3 Tg N2O‐N/year over the same period, accounting for 82% of the total increase. Regionally, China, South Asia, and Southeast Asia underwent rapid increases in cropland N2O emissions since the 1970s. However, US cropland N2O emissions had been relatively flat in magnitude since the 1980s, and EU cropland N2O emissions appear to have decreased by 14%. Soil N2O emissions from predominantly natural ecosystems accounted for 67% of the global soil emissions in the recent decade but showed only a relatively small increase of 0.7 ± 0.5 Tg N2O‐N/year (11%) since the 1860s. In the recent decade, N fertilizer application, N deposition, manure N application, and climate change contributed 54%, 26%, 15%, and 24%, respectively, to the total increase. Rising atmospheric CO2 concentration reduced soil N2O emissions by 10% through the enhanced plant N uptake, while land cover change played a minor role. Our estimation here does not account for indirect emissions from soils and the directed emissions from excreta of grazing livestock. To address uncertainties in estimating regional and global soil N2O emissions, this study recommends several critical strategies for improving the process‐based simulations.

2019-01-25	Global Nitrous Oxide Emissions From Pasturelands and Rangelands: Magnitude, Spatiotemporal Patterns, and Attribution 	Global Biogeochemical Cycles	The application of manure and mineral nitrogen (N) fertilizer, and livestock excreta deposition are the main drivers of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in agricultural systems. However, the magnitude and spatiotemporal variations of N2O emissions due to different management practices (excreta deposition and manure/fertilizer application) from grassland ecosystems remain unclear. In this study, we used the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model to simulate the spatiotemporal variation in global N2O emissions and their attribution to different sources from both intensively managed (pasturelands) and extensively managed (rangelands) grasslands during 1961–2014. Over the study period, pasturelands and rangelands experienced a significant increase in N2O emissions from 1.74 Tg N2O‐N in 1961 to 3.11 Tg N2O‐N in 2014 (p < 0.05). Globally, pasturelands and rangelands were responsible for 54% (2.2 Tg N2O‐N) of the total agricultural N2O emissions (4.1 Tg N2O‐N) in 2006. Natural and anthropogenic sources contributed 26% (0.64 Tg N2O‐N/year) and 74% (1.78 Tg N2O‐N/year) of the net emissions, respectively. Across different biomes, pasturelands (i.e., C3 and C4) were the single largest contributor to N2O fluxes, accounting for 86% of the net global emissions from grasslands. Among different sources, livestock excreta deposition contributed 54% of the net emissions, followed by manure N (13%) and mineral N (7%) application. Regionally, southern Asia contributed 38% of the total emissions, followed by Europe (29%) and North America (16%). Our modeling study demonstrates that livestock excreta deposition and manure/fertilizer application have dramatically altered the N cycle in pasturelands, with a substantial impact on the climate system.
