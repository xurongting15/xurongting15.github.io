title: "Deformation Mechanisms and Macromolecular Structure Response of Anthracite under Different Stress"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2016-01-16-han_ef_2016
excerpt: 'It has been controversial whether tectonic stress affects the chemical structure of coals. To further understand if and how tectonic stress affects the chemical structure of coals, an investigation into the macromolecular-level deformation mechanism is quite necessary. Therefore, we performed deformation experiments on anthracite with axial load both parallel and perpendicular to the bedding plane. Macromolecular structure variations during deformation were revealed by a combination of Raman spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Results show that (1) coal deformation behaviors (brittle deformation or ductile deformation) are influenced by stress direction, in addition to the temperature and strain rate, and (2) ductile deformation is related to the growth of defects, which is more favorable under stress parallel to the bedding plane, at higher temperature and lower strain rate, while brittle deformation is presumably due to the direct bond breakage beyond the elastic limit. On the basis of the study of coal deformation mechanisms, we suggest that hydrocarbon generation under stress is possible and that it may become a supplement for the traditional hydrocarbon generation theory.'
